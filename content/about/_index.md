I am a versatile full-stack software developer living in San Francisco.  I believe in creating beautiful and responsive UI components... one div at a time.

I hope to learn something new every day. I want to constantly update myself with the flow of technology. I am on a journey of self-development, to get better at programming, at interacting with technology, to learn how we and machines can act together for the advancement of human kind.

		<div class="back">
