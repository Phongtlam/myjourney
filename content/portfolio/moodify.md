<a href="https://moooodify.herokuapp.com/" target="_blank"><strong>Moodify</strong></a> was an application designed for musical analysis.</p>

<!--more-->

The program aims to give a better understanding of lyrical music. Using Spotify API as our main search engine, we look up MusixMatch for matching lyrics. The resulted data is then parsed through to IBM Watson Tone Analyzer. Finally, we used Chart.JS to display the findings for the users.
