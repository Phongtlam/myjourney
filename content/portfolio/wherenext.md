## User Stories and Motivation:
- Travelers often times do not know where to go in a new city. How can we help someone to quickly find places around San Francisco and beyond? Enter <a href="https://wherenxt.herokuapp.com/" target="_blank"><strong>Where Next?</strong></a>. This platform enables someone to browse for places without the need to create a Yelp/Google account. This will feature places with user ratings, average cost(where applicable) and a few other features.
- The motivation behind this is to create an easy and seamless user experience without the need to create complicated profiles and login services.

## Project overview:

- Quick and responsive UI components built with React and Bootstrap
- Node.JS with Express for a lightweight back end server
- dotenv to load environment-specific variables
- redis as in-memory, database storage solution
